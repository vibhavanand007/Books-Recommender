Built a Book Recommendation System leveraging both popularity-based and collaborative filtering methods. The system recommends books based on user ratings and similar book preferences using a cosine similarity matrix. Developed using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn, with data stored in CSV files and serialized using pickle for efficient retrieval. Flask is used to deploy the project for real-time recommendations, with the project hosted on Render.
